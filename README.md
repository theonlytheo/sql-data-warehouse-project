# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to my first SQL project from **Data With Baraa** big shoutout to him for make the course 100% free. You can access the tutorial from link that I attached in the end.
This **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** demonstrates a comprehensive data warehouse. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.
This project include a three phase work, starting from SQL Datawarehouse, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Advanced Data Analytics.

## üèóÔ∏è Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture that consist **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![DataArchitecture](docs/DataArchitecture.png)

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is coming from CSV files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization and normalization processes to prepare the data for analysis
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## üìñ Project Overview
This projects is containing:

1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold Layers.
2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from the system into the warehouse.
3. Analytics and Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboard for actionable insights.

üéØIn this project as the sources mentioned, I want to showcase expertise in:
